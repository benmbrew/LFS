- predict_cancer - not needed for cluster - you have results with training and testing on full data
- predict_acc- has weird error, but needs to be put on cluster WITH PRED.
- model_pipeline and model_pipeline_fac can be run on cluster now.
- test_pipeline needs to be edited for pred to work (then run it).
- need to predict random - increase features sequintially
- eventually need to try other normilization methods.

SURV
- run model_pipeline and model_pipeline_fac for funnorm and quan
 with bh dims and correct gender (running).
- look at results
- test quan and funnorm on controls and validation
- do batch correction on sentrix ids for raw
- rerun pipeline with new batch correction for raw


- currently running raw, quan, funnorm for both reg and fac.
because of mistake - each fac should be in respective folders, but each reg will all be in reg_results, marked accordingly.
