# clean clinical data
# plot cancer age variation 
# subset for tp53 mutants 
# age is response variable, do one with binary > 5 years and one as continous.
# protein and gdna are one to one mapping, use one, probably protein. 
# cancer is random effects, "whatever other clinical data that you donâ€™t have for every 
# individual and potentially gender" summa
# turn data into list of k folds 
# female is 1, male is zero
# protein and rdna missing can be "not found"
# Different penalties- ridge, lasso, elastic net
# Treat missing as random effects in LMM
# start with just clinical and successivley add methylation
# compare lme4 and glmmLasso on basic model. 
# duplicate in clin because 1087 and 1087/1094.
# clean read in code and get rid of uncessary objects
# read paper in multiple random effects
